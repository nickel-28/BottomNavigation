## BottomNavigation

This app is basically the implementation of Bottom Navigation bar and the concept of 'Fragments'. It allows user to switch between different activities/fragments.
The concept of Bottom Navigation is used in apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, Flipkart, etc. <br>
It consists of 3 fragments- (i) **Home**, (ii) **Message**, and (iii) **Profile** <br>
When '*Home*' fragment is selected, the screen will show a *TextView* as "First Fragment". <br>
When '*Message*' fragment is selected, the screen will show a *TextView* as "Second Fragment". <br>
When '*Profile*' fragment is selected, the screen will show a *TextView* as "Third Fragment". <br>
