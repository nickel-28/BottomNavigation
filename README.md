## BottomNavigation

This app is basically the implementation of Bottom Navigation bar and the concept of 'Fragments'. It allows user to switch between different activities/fragments.
The concept of Bottom Navigation is used in apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, Flipkart, etc.
It consists of 3 fragments- (i) **Home**, (ii) **Message**, and (iii) **Profile**
When '*Home*' fragment is selected, the screen will show a *TextView* as "First Fragment".
When '*Message*' fragment is selected, the screen will show a *TextView* as "Second Fragment".
When '*Profile*' fragment is selected, the screen will show a *TextView* as "Third Fragment".

**Tools Used**

I have made this project using **Kotlin** and **XML**
